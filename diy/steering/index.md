# Steering

![Banner image](banner.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

The mobility scooter might have a steering column that is too long or too short. If it is too long, cut it to the required length and weld on a horizontal piece of 20mm square tube, if it is too short, extend it and weld on a piece of horizontal steel. 

In the photo below, the original handle bars were removed, the steering column was cut to a suitable length and the original handle bars were welded back on.

### Electric bike throttle
If you wish to use an electric bike throttle, you will need to use round tubing to suit the throttle.
