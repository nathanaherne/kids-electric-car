The main thing that limits this project is the number of mobility scooters, electric wheelchairs or golf carts that are donated. Every one that gets donated allows us to help another family, school or community project. If you would like to donate a mobility scooter, electric wheelchair or golf cart to our project, please contact us on the above details.

We would like to extend a sincere thank you to the people and organizations who have donated their time, facilities, mobility scooters, electric wheelchairs or golf carts to this project. Because of your donations, this project has been able to bring joy, education and connection to people's lives.
